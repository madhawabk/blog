                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Loss functions are a critical component of neural networks, used to measure the difference between the predicted output and the actual target value. The primary goal of training a neural network is to minimize this loss, thereby improving the accuracy of the model's predictions. Different loss functions are used for different types of tasks, such as regression, classification, and ranking problems.</p>

                <h2>Importance of Loss Functions</h2>
                <p>The choice of loss function impacts the performance and convergence of a neural network. A well-chosen loss function helps the network to learn effectively, while an inappropriate loss function can lead to poor model performance or slow convergence. The loss function guides the optimization algorithm in adjusting the weights and biases of the network during training.</p>

                <h2>Types of Loss Functions</h2>
                <p>There are several types of loss functions, each suited to different types of tasks. Here we discuss the most commonly used loss functions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mean Squared Error (MSE):</strong> Commonly used for regression tasks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mean Absolute Error (MAE):</strong> Another popular choice for regression tasks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Binary Cross-Entropy:</strong> Used for binary classification tasks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Categorical Cross-Entropy:</strong> Used for multi-class classification tasks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hinge Loss:</strong> Used for training classifiers such as Support Vector Machines.</li>
                    <li><strong>Kullback-Leibler Divergence:</strong> Used for measuring the difference between two probability distributions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Huber Loss:</strong> Used for regression tasks, combining MSE and MAE.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section id="mean-squared-error">
                <h2>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</h2>
                <p>Mean Squared Error is a common loss function for regression tasks. It measures the average of the squares of the errors between the predicted and actual values. The formula for MSE is:</p>
                <p>
                    $$ \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 $$
                </p>
                <p>where \( y_i \) is the actual value, \( \hat{y}_i \) is the predicted value, and \( n \) is the number of samples.</p>
                <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Simple to implement and understand.</li>
                    <li>Provides a smooth gradient, which helps in the optimization process.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can be heavily influenced by outliers, as errors are squared.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Where to Use:</strong> MSE is best suited for regression tasks where the impact of outliers is minimal or can be managed through other means, such as data preprocessing.</p>

                <h2>Mean Absolute Error (MAE)</h2>
                <p>Mean Absolute Error measures the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values. The formula for MAE is:</p>
                <p>
                    $$ \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y}_i| $$
                </p>
                <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE.</li>

                <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The gradient is not smooth, which can make optimization more challenging.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Where to Use:</strong> MAE is suitable for regression tasks where robustness to outliers is important.</p>
