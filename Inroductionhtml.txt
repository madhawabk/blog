            <h2>What is a Neural Network?</h2>
            <p>A neural network is a series of algorithms that attempts to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. Neural networks can adapt to changing input so the network generates the best possible result without needing to redesign the output criteria.</p>

            <h2>Basic Components of a Neural Network</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Neurons:</strong> The basic unit of a neural network, also known as nodes. They receive input, process it, and pass on the output to the next layer.</li>
                <li><strong>Layers:</strong> Neural networks are structured in layers. Typically, they include an input layer, hidden layers, and an output layer.</li>
                <li><strong>Weights:</strong> These are the parameters within the network that transform input data within the network's layers.</li>
                <li><strong>Activation Functions:</strong> Functions that determine the output of each neuron. Examples include ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Types of Neural Networks</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN):</strong> The simplest type of artificial neural network. Data moves in one directionâ€”from input nodes, through hidden nodes (if any), to output nodes.</li>
                <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):</strong> Primarily used for image recognition tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in data.</li>
                <li><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):</strong> Suitable for sequential data as they use their internal state (memory) to process sequences of inputs.</li>
                <li><strong>Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN):</strong> Consist of two networks (a generator and a discriminator) that contest with each other, often used for generating synthetic data.</li>
            </ul>
